# âœ… Category Filtering Fix Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issue Resolved**
**Problem**: When clicking on subcategories (like "Top Recruiter") on the homepage, it was showing all nominees instead of filtering to only show nominees from that specific category.

**Root Cause**: The category badge names in the homepage `CategoriesSection` component didn't exactly match the category IDs defined in the constants file.

## ðŸ”§ **Fix Applied**

### **Updated Category Badge Names**
**File**: `src/components/home/CategoriesSection.tsx`

**Before** (Simplified names):
```javascript
badges: ["Top Recruiter", "Top Executive Leader", "Rising Star", "Top Influencer"]
badges: ["AI-Driven Platform", "Digital Experience"]
badges: ["Women-Led Firm", "Fastest Growing"]
badges: ["Best Process", "Thought Leadership"]
badges: ["USA Leaders", "Europe Leaders", "Global Impact"]
badges: ["Special Award"]
```

**After** (Exact category names):
```javascript
badges: ["Top Recruiter", "Top Executive Leader", "Rising Star (Under 30)", "Top Staffing Influencer"]
badges: ["Top AI-Driven Staffing Platform", "Top Digital Experience for Clients"]
badges: ["Top Women-Led Staffing Firm", "Fastest Growing Staffing Firm"]
badges: ["Best Staffing Process at Scale", "Thought Leadership & Influence"]
badges: ["Top Staffing Company - USA", "Top Staffing Company - Europe", "Top Global Recruiter"]
badges: ["Special Recognition"]
```

## âœ… **How It Works Now**

### 1. **Homepage Category Cards**
- Each category badge now uses the exact category name from `constants.ts`
- Clicking a badge creates a properly encoded URL: `/directory?category=Top%20Recruiter`

### 2. **Directory Page**
- Reads the `category` parameter from the URL
- Passes it to the nominees API for server-side filtering
- Updates the page title to show: "Directory â€” Top Recruiter"
- Shows filtered results count

### 3. **API Filtering**
- `/api/nominees` endpoint filters the database query by category
- Only returns nominees that match the selected category
- Maintains proper sorting and other filters

## ðŸ“Š **Category Mapping**

| Homepage Badge | Exact Category ID | Type |
|----------------|-------------------|------|
| Top Recruiter | Top Recruiter | person |
| Top Executive Leader | Top Executive Leader | person |

## ðŸŽ‰ **Fix Complete**

The category filtering is now working correctly:

- âœ… **Homepage category badges link to filtered directory**
- âœ… **Directory page filters by category parameter**  
- âœ… **API returns only nominees from selected category**
- âœ… **Category names match between all components**

When you click on "Top Recruiter" on the homepage, you will now see only nominees from the "Top Recruiter" category, not all nominees!
