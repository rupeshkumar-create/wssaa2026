# New Schema Integration Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
The World Staffing Awards application has been successfully migrated to use the new improved database schema. The new schema provides proper normalization with separate tables for nominators, nominees, nominations, voters, and votes.

## Schema Structure

### Tables Created
- **nominators**: People who submit nominations
- **nominees**: People or companies being nominated  
- **nominations**: Links nominators to nominees in specific categories
- **voters**: People who vote for nominees
- **votes**: Individual votes cast by voters
- **hubspot_outbox**: Queue for HubSpot sync

### Views Created
- **public_nominees**: Approved nominations with computed display fields
- **admin_nominations**: All nominations with nominator and nominee details
- **voting_stats**: Aggregated voting statistics by category

## Manual Testing Ready

The application is now ready for comprehensive manual testing:

### üåê Frontend Testing
- **Homepage**: http://localhost:3000 - View approved nominees
- **Nomination Form**: http://localhost:3000/nominate - Submit new nominations
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:3000/admin - Manage nominations
- **Voting**: Test voting functionality on nominee cards

### üìä API Testing
- **GET /api/nominees** - Fetch approved nominees
- **GET /api/nominees?subcategoryId=top-recruiter** - Filter by category
- **POST /api/nomination/submit** - Submit nominations
- **POST /api/vote** - Cast votes
- **GET /api/admin/nominations** - Admin view

### üîç Database Verification
All data is properly normalized and relationships are maintained:
- Nominators are deduplicated by email
- Nominees are separate entities linked to nominations
- Votes are properly counted via database triggers
- HubSpot sync queue is populated for external integrations

## Key Improvements

### üöÄ Performance
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Optimized views for common data access patterns
- Efficient vote counting via database triggers

### üîí Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- Check constraints validate data types and states
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate votes per category

### üìà Scalability
- Normalized structure supports growth
- Separate tables allow for independent scaling
- Views provide abstraction for frontend consumption

### üîß Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive type definitions

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing**: Thoroughly test all functionality through the web interface
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor query performance with real usage
3. **Data Migration**: If needed, migrate any existing production data
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation for new endpoints
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to production environment
