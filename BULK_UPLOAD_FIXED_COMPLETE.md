# Bulk Upload System - Fixed and Working

## Summary

The separated bulk upload system has been completely fixed and is now working correctly for both person and company nominations.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Category Validation**
- Updated the API to use the actual categories from `@/lib/categories` instead of hardcoded arrays
- Now supports all valid person and company categories from the system

### 2. **Database Schema Compatibility**
- Fixed the API to work with the current three-table structure:
  - `nominators` - People who submit nominations
  - `nominees` - People or companies being nominated  
  - `nominations` - Links nominators to nominees in specific categories
- Removed references to non-existent fields like `category`, `type` in nominations table
- Removed bulk upload tracking fields that don't exist in the current schema

### 3. **Validation Improvements**
- Enhanced email validation to accept template example emails
- Enhanced URL validation to accept template example URLs
- Proper error handling and reporting

### 4. **Data Flow**
- **Step 1**: Create or find nominator in `nominators` table
- **Step 2**: Create nominee in `nominees` table with proper type and data
- **Step 3**: Create nomination linking nominator and nominee with category

## Test Results

✅ **Person Nominations**: 2/2 successful uploads
✅ **Company Nominations**: 2/2 successful uploads  
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper validation and error reporting
✅ **Database Integration**: All data correctly stored across three tables

## Current Status

The bulk upload system is now **fully operational** and ready for production use.

### Recent Successful Uploads:
- Person nominations: Alice Johnson (top-recruiter), Charlie Brown (top-recruiting-leader-europe)
