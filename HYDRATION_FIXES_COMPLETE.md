# Hydration Fixes Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Section HTTP 500 Error
- **Problem**: Admin nominations API was trying to access fields from old schema
- **Solution**: Updated `/api/admin/nominations` to use `admin_nominations` view with correct field mappings
- **Files Changed**: `src/app/api/admin/nominations/route.ts`

### 2. Directory Showing "Unknown" Names
- **Problem**: Nominees API was querying wrong table/view structure
- **Solution**: Updated `/api/nominees` to use `public_nominees` view with proper field mappings
- **Files Changed**: `src/app/api/nominees/route.ts`

### 3. Hydration Mismatch Errors
- **Problem**: Components were rendering different content on server vs client
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Added `isClient` state guards in `StatsSection` component
  - Fixed object mutation in `CardNominee` component
  - Added client-side rendering guards in `DirectoryContent`
- **Files Changed**: 
  - `src/components/home/StatsSection.tsx`
  - `src/components/directory/CardNominee.tsx`
  - `src/app/directory/page.tsx`

## Technical Details

### API Route Updates

#### Admin Nominations API (`/api/admin/nominations`)
- Now queries `admin_nominations` view instead of direct table access
- Properly maps all enhanced schema fields including:
  - Contact details (email, phone, country)
  - LinkedIn profiles (person vs company)
  - Nominator information
  - Admin notes and rejection reasons

#### Nominees API (`/api/nominees`)
- Now queries `public_nominees` view for consistent data
- Uses computed fields from the view:
  - `display_name` for consistent naming
  - `image_url` for proper image handling
  - `linkedin_url` for correct LinkedIn mapping
  - `why_vote` for voting text

### Component Fixes

#### StatsSection Component
- Added `isClient` state to prevent hydration mismatch
- Returns static content during SSR, dynamic content after hydration
- Prevents server/client rendering differences

#### CardNominee Component
- Removed direct object mutation of `nomineeData.name`
- Uses computed `displayName` variable instead
- Prevents hydration mismatch from object changes

#### Directory Page
- Added client-side rendering guard
- Ensures data fetching only happens on client
- Prevents SSR/client data inconsistencies

- **Directory**: http://localhost:3004/directory
- **Home Page**: http://localhost:3004/

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Admin panel loads without HTTP 500 errors
2. ✅ Directory shows proper nominee names (not "Unknown")
3. ✅ No hydration mismatch errors in browser console
