# WSA Voter Tagging and Form Fixes - COMPLETE

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ HubSpot Voter Tagging Issue
**Problem**: Voters were being tagged as "WSA Voter 2026" instead of "WSA 2026 Voters"

**Solution**: 
- Updated `src/server/hubspot/realtime-sync.ts` to use correct tag "WSA 2026 Voters"
- Updated HubSpot property options to include the correct tag value
- Fixed the `setupHubSpotCustomProperties()` function to create the correct dropdown options

**Files Modified**:
- `src/server/hubspot/realtime-sync.ts` - Line 344: Changed voter tag from "WSA Voter 2026" to "WSA 2026 Voters"
- `src/server/hubspot/realtime-sync.ts` - Line 577: Updated property options array

### 2. ✅ Form Button Text Issue
**Problem**: Nomination form showed "Submit Vote" button instead of "Submit Nomination"

**Solution**: 
- Changed button text from "Submit Vote" to "Submit Nomination" in the review step
- This is correct since nominations are currently open, not voting

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/form/Step10ReviewSubmit.tsx` - Line 165: Changed button text

### 3. ✅ Thank You Message Update
**Problem**: Generic thank you message after nomination submission

**Solution**: 
- Updated success message to be more informative and specific
- Added details about the review process and nominee notification

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/form/Step10ReviewSubmit.tsx` - Lines 47-51: Enhanced success message

### 4. ✅ Voting Timeline Update
**Problem**: Incorrect voting start date mentioned in form

**Solution**: 
- Updated voting start date from "September 15, 2025" to "February 15, 2025"

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/form/Step10ReviewSubmit.tsx` - Line 134: Updated voting date

## Implementation Details

### HubSpot Voter Sync Flow
When a user casts a vote, the system now:
1. Creates/updates voter contact in HubSpot
2. Sets `wsa_contact_tag` property to "WSA 2026 Voters"
3. Sets `wsa_role` property to "Voter"
4. Sets `wsa_year` property to "2026"
5. Includes all voter details (name, email, company, etc.)

### Form Flow Corrections
The nomination form now correctly:
1. Shows "Submit Nomination" button (not "Submit Vote")
2. Displays appropriate success message explaining the review process
3. Shows correct voting timeline information
4. Maintains all existing validation and functionality

## Testing

### Scripts Created
- `scripts/fix-hubspot-voter-tag-js.js` - Updates HubSpot property options
- `scripts/test-voter-api-direct.js` - Tests the vote API endpoint

### Verification Steps
1. ✅ HubSpot property updated with correct tag options
2. ✅ Voter sync function uses correct tag "WSA 2026 Voters"
3. ✅ Form displays correct button text and messages
4. ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Current Status

### ✅ RESOLVED - No More Repetition Needed
