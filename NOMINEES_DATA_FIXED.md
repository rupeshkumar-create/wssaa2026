- Now shows real nominees in the top 3 rankings for each category

### 3. **Admin Dashboard Fixed**
- Updated `/api/admin/nominations` to load from local file
- Admin panel now shows all your uploaded nominees with proper data

- Updated category definitions to match your actual data
- Added support for all 19 categories in your nominations:
