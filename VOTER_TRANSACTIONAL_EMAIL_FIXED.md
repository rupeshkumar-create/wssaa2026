# ✅ Voter Transactional Email - FIXED & WORKING

## 🎯 Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

The voter transactional email system is now **100% working**. All tests pass and emails are being sent successfully.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Loops Dashboard Configuration
- **Issue**: Email template was using contact properties instead of data variables
- **Solution**: Template configured to use only data variables (no contact properties)

### 2. Code Implementation
- ✅ Transactional service properly configured
- ✅ Vote API triggers email automatically
- ✅ All data variables mapped correctly
- ✅ Error handling implemented

## 📧 Email Flow

### When a User Votes:
1. **Vote Cast** → API validates and stores vote
2. **Email Triggered** → Loops transactional email sent automatically
3. **Data Variables** → All voter and nominee info included
4. **Summit Pass** → Personalized World Staffing Summit access

### Email Contains:
- ✅ Voter's name and details
- ✅ Nominee they voted for
- ✅ Category information
- ✅ Vote timestamp
- ✅ Nominee profile link
- ✅ World Staffing Summit pass section
