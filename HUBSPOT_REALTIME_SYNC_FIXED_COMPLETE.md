# HubSpot Real-time Sync - COMPLETELY FIXED ‚úÖ

## Problem Resolved
The nominator with email "0n7v2@powerscrews.com" and other contacts were not syncing to HubSpot in real-time due to incorrect WSA tag values that didn't match the HubSpot dropdown options.

## Root Cause
The HubSpot sync was failing because the tag values in the code didn't match the actual dropdown values configured in HubSpot:

**Code was using:**
- "Nominator 2026" ‚ùå
- "Nominator 2026" (company tag) ‚ùå

**HubSpot actually had:**
- "WSA2026 Nominator" ‚úÖ (no space)
- "WSA 2026 Nominees" ‚úÖ
- "WSA 2026 Voters" ‚úÖ

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed WSA Tag Values
Updated all sync functions to use the correct HubSpot dropdown values:

```typescript
// Fixed tag mapping
switch (role) {
  case 'Nominator':
    properties.wsa_contact_tag = 'WSA2026 Nominator'; // Fixed: no space
    break;
  case 'Nominee_Person':
  case 'Nominee_Company':
    properties.wsa_contact_tag = 'WSA 2026 Nominees';
    break;
  case 'Voter':
    properties.wsa_contact_tag = 'WSA 2026 Voters';
    break;
}
```

### 2. Real-time Sync Points
- **Nomination Submission**: Syncs nominator immediately with "WSA2026 Nominator" tag
- **Vote Casting**: Syncs voter immediately with "WSA 2026 Voters" tag  
- **Nomination Approval**: Syncs nominee immediately with "WSA 2026 Nominees" tag

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
Created debug endpoints and test scripts to verify sync functionality:
- `debug-nominator` API endpoint for testing specific nominators
- Real-time sync verification scripts
- Outbox status checking
