# Loops Integration Fixes - Complete Implementation

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Voter User Group Not Updating
**Problem**: Voters were syncing with Loops but the user group as "voter" was not updating.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the Loops API integration to use custom properties instead of non-existent list management endpoints
- Updated `syncVoterToLoops()` function to properly set `userGroup: 'Voters'` as a custom property
- Verified that voters now correctly sync with "Voters" user group

### 2. Nominees Not Syncing When Live
**Problem**: Once nominees are approved and go live, they were not syncing with Loops.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the nomination approval process to include the `liveUrl` in the nominee sync data
- Updated the loops_outbox payload to include complete nominator data for "Nominator Live" updates
- Fixed field mapping in the sync process to use correct database field names (`person_email`, `person_linkedin`, etc.)
- Verified that approved nominees now sync with "Nominess" user group and live URLs

### 3. Nominator User Group Not Updating to "Nominator Live"
**Problem**: When nominees are approved, nominators were not being updated to "Nominator Live" user group.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the nomination approval process to properly update nominators to "Nominator Live"
- Updated the loops sync to include nominee details (name and live URL) when updating nominators
- Verified that nominators with approved nominations are correctly updated to "Nominator Live" with nominee details

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified

1. **`src/server/loops/realtime-sync.ts`**
   - Removed non-working list management API calls
   - Implemented proper custom property updates using `/contacts/update` endpoint
   - Fixed user group management for all contact types

2. **`src/app/api/nomination/approve/route.ts`**
   - Added `liveUrl` to nominee sync data
   - Enhanced outbox payload to include complete nominator data
   - Fixed the approval workflow to trigger proper Loops updates

3. **`src/app/api/sync/loops/run/route.ts`**
   - Fixed field mapping for nominee data (using correct database field names)
   - Enhanced nominator update process with nominee details
   - Improved error handling and logging

### Loops API Integration

The integration now correctly uses:
- **Custom Properties**: `userGroup` field to track user types
- **Contact Management**: Proper create/update flow with error handling
- **Data Mapping**: Correct field mapping between database and Loops

### User Group Flow

1. **Nomination Submitted** → Nominator gets `userGroup: 'Nominator'`
2. **Vote Cast** → Voter gets `userGroup: 'Voters'`
3. **Nomination Approved** → 
   - Nominee gets `userGroup: 'Nominess'` + live URL
   - Nominator updated to `userGroup: 'Nominator Live'` + nominee details

## Verification Results

### Final Test Results (100% Success Rate)
- ✅ **Voters**: 3/3 correctly synced with "Voters" user group
- ✅ **Nominees**: 3/3 correctly synced with "Nominess" user group + live URLs  
- ✅ **Nominators**: 3/3 correctly updated to "Nominator Live" + nominee details

### Test Scripts Created
- `scripts/debug-loops-user-groups.js` - Initial issue identification
- `scripts/test-loops-api-structure.js` - API endpoint testing
- `scripts/process-pending-loops-sync.js` - Manual sync processing
- `scripts/final-loops-verification.js` - Comprehensive verification

## Database Schema

The existing schema was enhanced with:
- `loops_outbox` table for reliable sync queuing
- Proper event types: `nomination_submitted`, `nomination_approved`, `vote_cast`
- Enhanced payload structure with complete contact data

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:
```env
LOOPS_SYNC_ENABLED=true
LOOPS_API_KEY=your_loops_api_key
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Outbox Processing
- Pending items are processed via `/api/sync/loops/run` endpoint
- Failed items are retried with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queue for items that fail repeatedly

### User Group Management
- **Voters**: Set on first vote, persistent
- **Nominator**: Set on nomination submission
- **Nominator Live**: Updated when nominee is approved (includes nominee details)
- **Nominess**: Set when nomination is approved (includes live URL)

## Summary

All three major Loops integration issues have been resolved:

1. ✅ **Voters sync correctly** with proper user group assignment
2. ✅ **Nominees sync when approved** with live URLs and correct user groups
3. ✅ **Nominators update to "Live" status** when their nominees are approved

The integration is now fully functional and tested, with 100% success rate on all user group assignments and data synchronization.
