# HubSpot Sync Status - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Issue Identified and Resolved

The HubSpot sync was failing with **400 Bad Request** errors due to an incorrect property name being used for LinkedIn URLs.

### Root Cause
- The sync code was using hardcoded `linkedin_url` property name
- HubSpot doesn't have a `linkedin_url` property by default
- The environment configuration specifies `HUBSPOT_CONTACT_LINKEDIN_KEY=linkedin`
- Our code should use the configured property name, not hardcoded values

### Fix Applied
Updated `src/server/hubspot/realtime-sync.ts` to use environment-configured LinkedIn property names:

```typescript
// Before (hardcoded - WRONG)
properties.linkedin_url = data.linkedin;

// After (environment-configured - CORRECT)
const linkedinKey = process.env.HUBSPOT_CONTACT_LINKEDIN_KEY || 'linkedin';
properties[linkedinKey] = data.linkedin;
```
