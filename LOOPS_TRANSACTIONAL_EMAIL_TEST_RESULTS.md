# Loops Transactional Email Integration - Test Results

The Loops transactional email integration has been successfully implemented and tested. When someone votes for a nominee, they will automatically receive a confirmation email with the nominee's profile link.

## 🧪 Tests Performed

### 1. Direct API Testing
- **Test**: Direct Loops transactional API calls
- **Result**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Details**: Both vote confirmation and raw transactional emails sent successfully
- **Response**: `{ success: true }`

### 2. Test Endpoint Testing
- **Test**: `/api/test/loops-transactional` endpoint
- **Result**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Email**: rupesh.kumar@candidate.ly
- **Response**: `{"success":true,"message":"vote_confirmation email sent successfully"}`

### 3. Real Vote Testing
- **Test**: Actual voting through `/api/vote` endpoint
- **Result**: ✅ SUCCESS

## 📧 Email Configuration

### Data Variables Available
```json
{
  "voterFirstName": "Rupesh",
  "voterLastName": "Kumar", 
  "voterFullName": "Rupesh Kumar",
  "nomineeDisplayName": "Browser Nominee",
  "nomineeUrl": "https://world-staffing-awards.vercel.app/nominee/...",

}
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
LOOPS_API_KEY=your_loops_api_key_here
LOOPS_TRANSACTIONAL_ENABLED=true  # Optional, defaults to true
```

### Integration Points
1. **Vote API**: `/api/vote` - Triggers email after successful vote
2. **Transactional Service**: `src/server/loops/transactional.ts`
3. **Test Endpoint**: `/api/test/loops-transactional` (dev only)

### Error Handling
- ✅ Graceful fallback if LOOPS_API_KEY not configured
- ✅ Non-blocking - vote still succeeds if email fails
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Automatic URL generation for nominees
