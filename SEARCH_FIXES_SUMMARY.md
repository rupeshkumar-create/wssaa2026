# Search Functionality Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Advanced Search Button Not Showing by Default
**Problem**: The advanced search button was only visible when there was text in the search bar.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the conditional `{value && (...)}` wrapper around the advanced filter button
- The button is now always visible, making advanced search options easily accessible

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/directory/AnimatedSearchBar.tsx`

### 2. Page Refreshing on Every Keystroke
**Problem**: Each keystroke in the search bar caused a page refresh due to `router.push()` calls.

**Solution**:
- Implemented local state management for immediate UI updates
- Added debounced URL updates (500ms delay) using `window.history.replaceState()`
- Removed `router.push()` calls that caused page navigation
- Search results update instantly without page refresh

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/nominees/page.tsx`

### 3. Variable Initialization Order Issue
**Problem**: Local state variables were being used before they were declared, causing runtime errors.

**Solution**:
- Moved local state declarations to the top of the component
- Removed duplicate state declarations
- Fixed useEffect dependency arrays
- Removed unused `useRouter` import

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/nominees/page.tsx`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Local State Management
```typescript
// Local state for immediate UI updates without page refresh
const [localSearchQuery, setLocalSearchQuery] = useState("");
const [localSelectedCategory, setLocalSelectedCategory] = useState("");
const [localSelectedType, setLocalSelectedType] = useState("");
```

### Debounced URL Updates
```typescript
// Debounced URL update to avoid page refresh on every keystroke
useEffect(() => {
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    const params = new URLSearchParams();
    if (localSearchQuery) params.set('q', localSearchQuery);
    if (localSelectedCategory) params.set('category', localSelectedCategory);
    if (localSelectedType) params.set('type', localSelectedType);
    
    const newUrl = `/nominees${params.toString() ? `?${params.toString()}` : ''}`;
    window.history.replaceState({}, '', newUrl);
  }, 500); // 500ms debounce

  return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
}, [localSearchQuery, localSelectedCategory, localSelectedType]);
```

### Enhanced Search Filtering
- Added company name to search criteria
- Improved search to include nominee name, category, and company
- Real-time filtering without API calls for better performance

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Instant Search Results**: No more page refreshes, results update immediately
2. **Always Accessible Advanced Search**: Button visible at all times
3. **Smooth Typing Experience**: No lag or interruption while typing
4. **URL Persistence**: Search state preserved in URL for sharing/bookmarking
5. **Better Performance**: Client-side filtering reduces server load
