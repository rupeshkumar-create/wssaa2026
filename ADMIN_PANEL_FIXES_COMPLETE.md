# Admin Panel Fixes Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hydration Error
**Problem**: React hydration mismatch in Navigation component
**Solution**: Added `mounted` state to prevent server/client mismatch in Navigation.tsx

### 2. Admin Panel Database Error
**Problem**: `additional_votes` column doesn't exist, causing admin API to fail
**Solution**: 
- Removed `additional_votes` from admin API query temporarily
- Set default values for vote fields
- Admin panel now loads without errors

### 3. HubSpot Voter Sync Tag
**Problem**: Voter sync was using "WSA 2026 Voters" instead of "WSA Voter 2026"
**Solution**: Updated HubSpot realtime sync to use correct tag "WSA Voter 2026"
