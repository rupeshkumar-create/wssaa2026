# Security Hardening Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Security Measures

### 1. Incident Hygiene (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to properly exclude all `.env` files
- ✅ Removed hardcoded secrets from main source code
- ✅ Updated environment variable examples with placeholders only
- ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Rotate all production credentials (Supabase, HubSpot, Loops, CRON secrets)

### 2. Admin Authentication System (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Implemented JWT-based session authentication
- ✅ Created secure login endpoint (`/api/admin/login`)
- ✅ Created logout endpoint (`/api/admin/logout`)
- ✅ Added bcrypt password hashing
- ✅ HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies
- ✅ Removed all hardcoded passcodes (`admin123`, `wsa2026`)
- ✅ Updated admin UI to use proper login form

### 3. Middleware Protection (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created `middleware.ts` protecting all admin routes:
  - `/admin/*` - Admin dashboard pages
  - `/api/admin/*` - Admin API endpoints
  - `/api/nomination/approve` - Nomination approval
  - `/api/votes/*` - Vote management
  - `/api/sync/hubspot/run` - Sync operations
- ✅ JWT verification for all protected routes
- ✅ Automatic redirect to login for unauthenticated users

### 4. API Endpoint Security (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Removed `X-Admin-Passcode` headers from all components
- ✅ Updated bulk upload endpoints to use middleware authentication
- ✅ Added SYNC_SECRET protection for sync endpoints
- ✅ Updated admin components to work with cookie-based auth

### 5. Rate Limiting (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Implemented rate limiting for `/api/vote`:
  - 10 votes per minute per IP
  - 200 votes per day per IP
- ✅ Proper rate limit headers and error responses
- ✅ IP-based tracking with automatic cleanup

### 6. Secure File Uploads (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created signed upload URL system (`/api/uploads/sign`)
- ✅ Server-side file type validation
- ✅ File size limits (10MB)
- ✅ Secure file paths with UUIDs
- ✅ Integration with Supabase Storage
- ✅ Utility functions for secure uploads

### 7. Security Headers (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Added comprehensive security headers via middleware:
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`
  - `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` (production)
  - Content Security Policy for admin pages

### 8. SEO Protection (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created `robots.txt` disallowing admin paths
- ✅ Added `noindex, nofollow` meta tags to admin pages
- ✅ Prevented search engine indexing of sensitive areas

### 9. Development Tools (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Password hash generation script (`scripts/generate-admin-hash.js`)
- ✅ Comprehensive security audit script (`scripts/security-audit.js`)
- ✅ Secure upload utilities (`src/lib/secure-upload.ts`)
- ✅ Rate limiting utilities (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`)

## 🔧 Required Setup Actions

### 1. Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Admin Authentication (REQUIRED)
ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@yourcompany.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASHES=your_bcrypt_hash_here
SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=your-jwt-signing-secret-min-32-chars

# Sync Protection
SYNC_SECRET=your-strong-sync-secret-key
CRON_SECRET=your-cron-secret-key

# Optional: Rate Limiting with Redis
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_upstash_redis_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_upstash_redis_token
```

### 2. Generate Credentials
```bash
# Generate secrets and password hashes
node scripts/generate-admin-hash.js

# Generate hash for specific password
node scripts/generate-admin-hash.js "your-secure-password"
```

### 3. Supabase Storage Setup
1. Create storage bucket: `wsa-uploads`
2. Configure appropriate RLS policies
3. Test upload functionality

### 4. Verify Security
```bash
# Run security audit
node scripts/security-audit.js

# Should pass without critical issues
```

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

### Admin Authentication
- **Old**: Hardcoded passcode authentication
- **New**: Email/password login with JWT sessions
- **Impact**: All admin users need proper credentials

### File Uploads
- **Old**: Direct upload to `public/uploads`
- **New**: Signed uploads to Supabase Storage
- **Impact**: Update any file upload implementations

### API Headers
- **Old**: `X-Admin-Passcode` header required
- **New**: Cookie-based authentication
- **Impact**: Remove passcode headers from API calls

## 📊 Security Audit Results

After implementation, the security audit should show:
- ✅ No critical hardcoded secrets in source code
- ✅ JWT-based admin authentication implemented
- ✅ Security dependencies installed
- ✅ Protected endpoints have authentication checks

## 🔄 Migration Checklist

- [ ] Update production environment variables
- [ ] Generate and set admin password hashes
- [ ] Test admin login functionality
- [ ] Verify file upload works with new system
- [ ] Run security audit and fix any remaining issues
- [ ] Test rate limiting on vote endpoint
- [ ] Verify security headers in production
- [ ] Update any external integrations using old auth

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up environment variables and test locally
2. **Pre-deployment**: Run security audit and fix any critical issues
3. **Post-deployment**: Monitor for failed login attempts and rate limit violations
4. **Ongoing**: Regular security audits and dependency updates

## 🛡️ Security Posture

The platform now has:
- ✅ Production-ready authentication system
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation
- ✅ Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- ✅ Secure file handling
- ✅ Proper security headers
- ✅ Audit tools and monitoring capabilities

This implementation provides a solid security foundation suitable for production deployment.
