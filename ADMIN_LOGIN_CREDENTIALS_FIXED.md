# Admin Login Credentials Fixed

## Issue
The admin login was showing "Invalid credentials" error when using the correct email and password.

## Root Cause
The bcrypt password hash in the `.env` file was being incorrectly parsed due to the `$` characters in the hash being interpreted as shell variables by the environment loader.

## Solution
Updated the `.env` file to properly escape the bcrypt hash:

**Before:**
```
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASHES=$2b$12$31ImP/z1Exj0CFCAgIdNsupEKMWjLNgGsD371n55ZL9/hhz9MY/Ti
```

**After:**
```
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASHES="\$2b\$12\$31ImP/z1Exj0CFCAgIdNsupEKMWjLNgGsD371n55ZL9/hhz9MY/Ti"
```

## Admin Login Credentials
- **Email:** admin@worldstaffingawards.com
- **Password:** WSA2026Admin!Secure

## Verification
✅ Admin login now works correctly
✅ Password hash is properly loaded (60 characters)
✅ Authentication system is functional

## Files Modified
- `world-staffing-awards/.env` - Fixed password hash escaping
- Cleaned up temporary debug code

The admin panel is now accessible with the correct credentials.
