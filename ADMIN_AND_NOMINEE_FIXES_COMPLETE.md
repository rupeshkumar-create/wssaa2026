# Admin Panel and Nominee Profile Fixes - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DOM Nesting Validation Errors in Admin Panel

**Problem**: React was throwing DOM nesting validation errors due to improper HTML structure with checkboxes and labels.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper `id` attributes to checkboxes
- Used `htmlFor` attributes on labels to properly associate them with checkboxes
- Fixed the structure to avoid nested interactive elements

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Fixed checkbox and label structure

### 2. Nominee Profile Page Errors

**Problem**: When clicking on nominee profiles (like Anil Kumar), the page was throwing JavaScript errors due to missing or undefined data properties.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive safety checks for all data properties
- Added fallback values for missing data
- Added error boundary for completely missing nominee data
- Made all property access safe with null coalescing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/nominee/[slug]/NomineeProfileClient.tsx` - Added safety checks and fallbacks

## Specific Fixes Applied

### Admin Panel DOM Structure
```tsx
// Before (causing DOM nesting errors)
<label className="text-sm font-medium cursor-pointer">
  <input type="checkbox" ... />
  Select all nominations
</label>

// After (proper structure)
<input type="checkbox" id="select-all-checkbox" ... />
<label htmlFor="select-all-checkbox" className="text-sm font-medium cursor-pointer">
  Select all nominations
</label>
```

### Nominee Profile Safety Checks
```tsx
// Before (could cause errors)
const nominee = nomineeData.nominee;
const imageUrl = nominee.imageUrl || nomineeData.imageUrl;

// After (safe with fallbacks)
const nominee = nomineeData.nominee || {};
const imageUrl = nominee.imageUrl || nomineeData.imageUrl || null;

// Added error boundary for missing data
if (!nomineeData || !nomineeData.nominee) {
  return <ErrorComponent />;
}
```
