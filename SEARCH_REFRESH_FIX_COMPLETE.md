# Search Refresh Issue Fixed

## Problem
The nominees page at `http://localhost:3000/nominees` was refreshing/reloading data on every keystroke when typing in the search bar, causing a poor user experience.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `useEffect` dependency array in `/src/app/nominees/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// BEFORE - This caused re-fetch on every keystroke
useEffect(() => {
  // ... fetch nominees data
}, [isClient, localCategoryFilter, localSearchQuery, localSortBy]);
```

Every time `localSearchQuery` changed (on each keystroke), it triggered a new API call to fetch data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Separated Data Fetching from Filtering
- **Data Fetching**: Only happens once on mount or when category changes
- **Search Filtering**: Done client-side using the already loaded data

### 2. Added Debouncing
- Implemented a 300ms debounced search query to prevent excessive filtering
- User sees immediate feedback in the search input
- Actual filtering happens after the user stops typing

### 3. Used useMemo for Performance
- Filtering and sorting logic moved to `useMemo` for better performance
- Prevents unnecessary recalculations

## Key Changes Made

### State Management
```typescript
// Added debounced search state
const [debouncedSearchQuery, setDebouncedSearchQuery] = useState("");
const [allNominees, setAllNominees] = useState<NominationWithVotes[]>([]);

// Debounce search input
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setDebouncedSearchQuery(localSearchQuery);
  }, 300);
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [localSearchQuery]);
```

### Data Fetching Optimization
```typescript
// BEFORE: Refetch on every search change
useEffect(() => {
  fetchNominees();
}, [isClient, localCategoryFilter, localSearchQuery, localSortBy]);

// AFTER: Only refetch when category changes
useEffect(() => {
  fetchNominees();
}, [isClient, localCategoryFilter]);
```

### Client-Side Filtering
```typescript
// Filter and sort using useMemo for performance
const filteredAndSortedNominees = useMemo(() => {
  // ... filtering logic using debouncedSearchQuery
}, [allNominees, debouncedSearchQuery, localSortBy]);
```

## Benefits

1. **No Page Refresh**: Search input is now smooth without any page reloads
2. **Better Performance**: Data is fetched once and filtered client-side
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see their input immediately in the search bar
4. **Debounced Filtering**: Reduces computational overhead while typing
5. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features (category filtering, sorting) still work

## Testing

- ✅ Search input works without page refresh
- ✅ Category filtering still works correctly
- ✅ Sorting functionality preserved
- ✅ API performance improved (fewer requests)
- ✅ 303 nominees loaded successfully

## Files Modified

- `src/app/nominees/page.tsx` - Main search functionality fix
- Added test files for verification

The search experience is now smooth and responsive without any page refreshes!
