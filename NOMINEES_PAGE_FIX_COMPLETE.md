# Nominees Page Fix - Complete

## Issue Description
The nominees page at http://localhost:3000/nominees was not working properly - it was showing a loading state or no content when users tried to access it.

## Root Cause
The original nominees page component had several issues:
1. Duplicate code in useEffect hooks
2. Complex state management that could cause race conditions
3. Overly aggressive data clearing on category changes
4. Potential JavaScript errors preventing proper rendering

## Solution Applied

### 1. Simplified Component Structure
- Cleaned up duplicate useEffect hooks
- Streamlined state management
- Removed unnecessary complexity

### 2. Fixed Data Fetching Logic
- Simplified the data fetching process
- Better error handling
- Clearer loading states

### 3. Improved Category Filtering
- Fixed category parameter handling
- Proper URL parameter synchronization
- Better debugging logs

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added proper error states
- Better user feedback
- Graceful fallbacks

## Files Modified

### Main Fix
- `src/app/nominees/page.tsx` - Completely rewritten with simplified logic

### Backup Created
- `src/app/nominees/page-backup.tsx` - Original file backed up

## Testing Results

### API Tests ✅
- `/api/nominees` - Returns 71 nominees
- `/api/nominees?category=top-recruiter` - Returns 25 filtered nominees
- Category filtering working correctly

### Page Tests ✅
- Home page loads correctly
- Nominees page accessible
- Category links functional

### Functionality Tests ✅
- All nominees display
- Category filtering works
- Search functionality intact
- Sorting options available

## How to Test

### 1. Basic Functionality

# Test category filtering
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/nominees?category=top-recruiter" | head -c 200
```

### 2. Browser Testing
1. Open http://localhost:3000/
2. Click "Nominees" in the navigation
3. Should show all nominees with proper layout
4. Click on any category badge (e.g., "Top Recruiters")

6. URL should update to `/nominees?category=top-recruiter`

### 3. Category Links from Home Page
1. Go to home page
2. Scroll to "Award Categories" section
3. Click on any category badge
4. Should redirect to nominees page with proper filtering
