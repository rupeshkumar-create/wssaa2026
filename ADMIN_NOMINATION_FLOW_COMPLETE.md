# Admin Nomination Flow - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully replaced the custom admin nomination form with the public nomination form (starting from Step 3) integrated into the admin panel. Admin nominations bypass nomination status checks and are properly tracked and processed.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. New Admin Nomination Component
- **File**: `src/components/admin/AdminNominationFlow.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Uses the same form steps as public nominations (Step 3 onwards)
  - Bypasses nomination status checks (works even when nominations are closed)
  - Uses mock admin nominator data
  - Shows progress indicator
  - Displays success message with next steps
  - Auto-resets form after successful submission

### 2. Database Schema Updates
- **File**: `ADD_NOMINATION_SOURCE_FIELD.sql`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `nomination_source` field to track 'public' vs 'admin' nominations
  - Updated `admin_nominations` view to include source tracking
  - Added database index for performance

### 3. Admin Panel Integration
- **File**: `src/app/admin/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced `AdminNominationForm` with `AdminNominationFlow`
  - Added "Added by Admin" badge for admin nominations
  - Updated TypeScript interfaces to include `nominationSource`

### 4. API Updates
- **File**: `src/app/api/admin/nominations-improved/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Include `nomination_source` in API responses
  - Support filtering by nomination source

### 5. Existing APIs Already Support Admin Flow
- **Nomination Submit API**: Already handles `bypassNominationStatus` and `isAdminNomination` flags
- **Approval API**: Already sends transactional emails with live page links when nominations are approved

## Workflow

### Admin Adding Nomination
1. Admin goes to "Add Nominee" tab in admin panel
2. Starts from Step 3 (Category Selection) - skips nominator info
3. Completes nomination form (same as public form)
4. Form bypasses nomination status checks
5. Nomination is submitted with `nomination_source: 'admin'`
6. Success message shows next steps

### Admin Approval Process
1. Admin-added nominations appear in "Nominations" tab
2. Show "Added by Admin" badge
3. Admin can approve/reject as normal
4. Upon approval:
   - Nominee receives transactional email with live page link
   - Nominee is synced to HubSpot and Loops
   - Live URL is auto-generated if not provided

### Email Flow
- **Admin Nomination**: No immediate emails (since admin is adding directly)
- **Upon Approval**: Nominee receives approval email with live page link
- **Nominator**: Admin user receives confirmation (using admin email)

## Database Schema

```sql
-- New field in nominations table
ALTER TABLE nominations 
ADD COLUMN nomination_source TEXT DEFAULT 'public' 
CHECK (nomination_source IN ('public', 'admin'));

-- Updated admin_nominations view includes nomination_source
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Admins
1. Go to Admin Panel â†’ "Add Nominee" tab
2. Select category and complete form
3. Form works even when public nominations are closed
4. Nomination appears in "Nominations" tab with "Added by Admin" badge
5. Approve nomination to send live page link to nominee

### For Developers
1. Apply database schema: `node scripts/apply-nomination-source-field.js`
2. All existing APIs support the new flow
3. Admin nominations are tracked with `nomination_source: 'admin'`

## Benefits

1. **Consistent UX**: Same form experience as public nominations
2. **Admin Privileges**: Works when nominations are closed
3. **Proper Tracking**: Clear distinction between admin and public nominations
4. **Email Integration**: Automatic transactional emails upon approval
5. **Live Page Generation**: Auto-generates nominee live pages
6. **CRM Sync**: Integrates with HubSpot and Loops workflows
