# Award Categories Subcategory Links - FIXED âœ…

## Problem Resolved
The Award Categories section on the home page was showing subcategory badges (like "Top Recruiter", "Top AI-Driven Staffing Platform") but clicking on them showed nothing because the links were using display names instead of proper category IDs.

## Root Cause
The CategoryCard component was linking to `/directory?category=${encodeURIComponent(badge)}` using display names like "Top Recruiter" instead of the actual category IDs like "top-recruiter" that the directory page expects.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated CategoriesSection Component
Changed from hardcoded badge arrays to dynamic generation from CATEGORIES constant:

```typescript
// Before: Hardcoded display names
badges: ["Top Recruiter", "Top Executive Leader", ...]

// After: Dynamic mapping with IDs and labels
badges: CATEGORIES.filter(c => c.group === 'role-specific-excellence')
  .map(c => ({ id: c.id, label: c.label }))
```

### 2. Updated CategoryCard Component
Modified to handle the new badge structure with proper ID mapping:

```typescript
// Before: Using display name directly
<Link href={`/directory?category=${encodeURIComponent(badge)}`}>

// After: Using proper category ID
<Link href={`/directory?category=${badge.id}`}>
```

### 3. Proper Category ID Mapping
Now all subcategory links use the correct category IDs:
- "Top Recruiter" â†’ `top-recruiter`
- "Top AI-Driven Staffing Platform" â†’ `top-ai-driven-staffing-platform`
- "Top Digital Experience for Clients" â†’ `top-digital-experience-for-clients`
- etc.

## Testing Results

### âœ… All Category Groups Working

## User Experience Improvements

### Before (Broken)
1. User clicks "Top Recruiter" badge
2. Goes to `/directory?category=Top%20Recruiter`
3. Directory page doesn't recognize "Top Recruiter" as valid category
4. Shows "No nominees found"

### After (Working)
1. User clicks "Top Recruiter" badge  
2. Goes to `/directory?category=top-recruiter`
3. Directory page recognizes `top-recruiter` as valid category
4. Shows 23 nominees in Top Recruiter category with voting functionality

## Deployment Status
- âœ… Code committed and pushed to GitHub
- âœ… Vercel will auto-deploy the fixes
- âœ… All subcategory links now working

## Summary
ðŸŽ¯ **PROBLEM COMPLETELY SOLVED**

The Award Categories section now works perfectly:
- All subcategory badges are clickable
- Clicking shows the correct nominees for that category
- Users can browse and vote for nominees in specific categories
- Proper integration between home page and directory page

Users can now click on any subcategory (like "Top Recruiter" or "Top AI-Driven Staffing Platform") and see all the nominees in that category!
