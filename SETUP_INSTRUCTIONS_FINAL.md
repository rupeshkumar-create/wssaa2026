# Admin Nomination System - Final Setup Instructions

## Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions to set up the complete admin nomination system with all the fixes requested.

## What This System Provides

### âœ… Fixed Issues
1. **Admin can nominate anytime** - Even when public nominations are closed
2. **Proper category dropdowns** - Shows subcategories grouped by main categories
3. **Draft approval workflow** - Nominations go to drafts first, then get approved
4. **Automatic nominee emails** - Nominees get notified when approved with their page link
5. **Correct transactional email** - Uses proper Loops email templates

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
- **Dynamic Categories**: Fetches from database instead of hardcoded constants
- **Type Filtering**: Shows only relevant categories (person/company/both)
- **Draft Management**: Admin panel to review and approve nominations
- **Email Integration**: Automatic approval emails with nominee page URLs
- **Bypass Controls**: Admin can nominate when public nominations are closed

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Database Schema Setup

**Option A: Manual Setup (Recommended)**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the entire content from `MANUAL_SCHEMA_SETUP.sql`
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor
5. Click "Run" to execute all statements
6. Verify the verification queries at the end show proper counts

**Option B: API Setup (Alternative)**
1. Ensure your development server is running (`npm run dev`)
2. Run: `node scripts/setup-admin-schema-simple.js`
3. Check the output for any errors

### Step 2: Verify Database Setup

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Check category groups
SELECT * FROM public.category_groups ORDER BY display_order;

-- Check subcategories with groups
SELECT 
  sc.name as subcategory,
  cg.name as category_group,
  sc.nomination_type
FROM public.subcategories sc
JOIN public.category_groups cg ON sc.category_group_id = cg.id
ORDER BY cg.display_order, sc.display_order;

-- Check settings
SELECT * FROM public.settings;
```

Expected results:
- 6 category groups
- 18 subcategories
- 1 settings record

### Step 3: Test the Admin Nomination System

1. **Access Admin Panel**
   ```
   Go to: http://localhost:3000/admin
   ```

2. **Test Category Loading**
   - Click "Add Nominee" tab
   - Verify category dropdown shows proper subcategories
   - Switch between "Person" and "Company" types
   - Verify categories filter correctly

3. **Create Test Nomination**
   - Fill out the form with test data
   - Use a real email address for testing
   - Click "Create Nomination"
   - Verify success message appears

4. **Check Draft Management**
   - Click "Drafts" tab
   - Verify your test nomination appears
   - Review the nomination details
   - Click "Approve" button

5. **Verify Email Sending**
   - Check if approval email was sent
   - Verify email contains nominee page URL
   - Check Loops dashboard for email delivery

6. **Verify Public Appearance**
   - Go to main nominations page
   - Verify approved nomination appears
   - Check nominee individual page works

### Step 4: Test Bypass Functionality

1. **Close Public Nominations**
   - In admin panel, go to "Settings" tab
   - Turn off "Nominations Open"
   - Save settings

2. **Test Admin Bypass**
   - Try creating another nomination as admin
   - Verify it works despite nominations being closed
   - Regular users should not be able to nominate

3. **Reopen Nominations**
   - Turn "Nominations Open" back on
   - Save settings

```

## Database Schema

### New Tables
1. **category_groups** - Main category groups (6 records)
2. **subcategories** - Award categories (18 records)
3. **admin_nominations** - Draft nominations pending approval
4. **settings** - Global nomination/voting controls
5. **loops_outbox** - Enhanced email queue

### Key Relationships
- subcategories â†’ category_groups (many-to-one)
- admin_nominations â†’ subcategories (many-to-one)
- nominations â†’ subcategories (many-to-one)

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Existing (should already be set)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
LOOPS_API_KEY=your_loops_api_key

# Optional
LOOPS_SYNC_ENABLED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Categories not loading**
   - Check if category tables exist in database
   - Verify API endpoint `/api/categories` works
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Draft nominations not appearing**
   - Verify `admin_nominations` table exists
   - Check if nomination was created successfully
   - Refresh the drafts panel

3. **Approval failing**
   - Check database constraints
   - Verify all required tables exist
   - Check server logs for errors

4. **Emails not sending**
   - Verify `LOOPS_API_KEY` is set
   - Check Loops dashboard for API errors
   - Verify email template IDs are correct

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Database Tables**
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name IN ('category_groups', 'subcategories', 'admin_nominations', 'settings');
   ```

2. **Test API Endpoints**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/categories
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/nominations/drafts
   ```

3. **Check Server Logs**
   - Look for database connection errors
   - Check for API validation errors
   - Verify email sending logs
