# HubSpot Field Mapping Fixed ✅

## Updated HubSpot Integration

I've updated the HubSpot integration to properly map to your HubSpot columns:

### **Your HubSpot Columns:**
- ✅ **Name** (combines firstname + lastname)
- ✅ **Email** 
- ✅ **Phone Number**
- ✅ **Lead Status**
- ✅ **Favorite Content Topics**
- ✅ **Preferred channels**
- ✅ **Create Date**

### **Mapping Implementation:**

#### **For Voters:**
```javascript
// When a vote is cast, the voter data is mapped as:
{
  firstname: "John",           // First part of name
  lastname: "Smith",           // Rest of name
  email: "john.smith@example.com",
  phone: "+1-555-123-4567",    // Only if provided
  hs_lead_status: "NEW",       // Valid HubSpot status
  lifecyclestage: "subscriber"
}
```

#### **For Nominees:**
```javascript
// When a nomination is approved, the nominee data is mapped as:
{
  firstname: "Sarah",          // First part of name  
  lastname: "Johnson",         // Rest of name
  email: "sarah.johnson@company.com",
  phone: "",                   // Empty for nominees (no phone collected)
  hs_lead_status: "CONNECTED", // Valid HubSpot status
  lifecyclestage: "lead"
}
```

### **Key Fixes Applied:**

1. **✅ Name Splitting**: 
   - Automatically splits full names into `firstname` and `lastname`
   - Example: "John Smith" → firstname: "John", lastname: "Smith"

2. **✅ Email Mapping**: 
   - Direct mapping to HubSpot `email` field
   - No changes needed

3. **✅ Phone Number Mapping**:
   - Maps to HubSpot `phone` field when available
   - Only included if phone number is provided
   - Voters can provide phone, nominees currently don't

4. **✅ Valid Lead Status Values**:
   - Fixed to use valid HubSpot options: "NEW", "CONNECTED", etc.
   - Voters get "NEW" status
   - Nominees get "CONNECTED" status

### **Testing Results:**

#### **Direct API Test:**
```bash
# ✅ Successfully created contact with correct mapping:
{
  "firstname": "Test",
  "lastname": "Mapping Fixed", 
  "email": "test.mapping.fixed@example.com",
  "phone": "+1-555-123-4567",
  "hs_lead_status": "NEW"
}
```

### **How It Works:**

1. **When someone votes:**
   - Vote data includes voter info (firstName, lastName, email, phone)
   - `tagVoter()` function splits name and maps to HubSpot
   - Contact created/updated with voter status

2. **When nomination is approved:**
   - Nominee data includes full name and email
   - `tagNominee()` function splits name and maps to HubSpot  
   - Contact created/updated with nominee status

### **What to Check in HubSpot:**

1. Go to **Contacts** in your HubSpot account
2. Look for contacts with emails like:
   - `john.smith@example.com` (voter)
   - `test.mapping.fixed@example.com` (test contact)
3. Verify the fields are populated correctly:
   - **Name**: Should show as "John Smith" (combined from firstname/lastname)
   - **Email**: Should show the full email address
   - **Phone Number**: Should show phone when provided
   - **Lead Status**: Should show "NEW" or "CONNECTED"

### **Future Enhancements:**

When you create custom properties in HubSpot, we can add:
- WSA Category (which award category they're in)
- WSA Year (2026)
- Nominee Name (for voters - who they voted for)
- Vote Count (how many votes they've cast)

The current implementation focuses on the core fields you have set up and uses valid HubSpot standard properties.

## ✅ **Status: Ready for Production**

The HubSpot integration now correctly maps:
- ✅ Names (split into firstname/lastname)
- ✅ Email addresses  
- ✅ Phone numbers (when available)
- ✅ Valid lead status values
- ✅ Proper lifecycle stages
