# HubSpot Sync Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## 🎯 Issue Summary
The HubSpot sync was not working for the specific contacts:
- **Nominator**: lepsibidre@necub.com  
- **Nominee**: cihora9623@cavoyar.com

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Tag Mismatch Issue
- **Problem**: HubSpot dropdown property expected "WSA2026 Nominator" (no space)
- **Code was sending**: "WSA 2026 Nominator" (with space)
- **Result**: 400 validation errors for nominators

### 2. Missing Vote Sync
- **Problem**: Vote cast events were not being processed
- **Result**: Voters were not being synced to HubSpot

### 3. Outbox Processing
- **Problem**: 94 unprocessed entries in hubspot_outbox table
- **Result**: Real-time sync failures were not being retried

## 🔧 Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Tag Values
```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
wsa_contact_tag: 'WSA 2026 Nominator'

// AFTER (correct)  
wsa_contact_tag: 'WSA2026 Nominator'
```

### 2. Added Vote Sync Support
- Added `syncVoterToHubSpot()` function
- Added vote_cast event processing in manual sync script
- Proper voter tagging with "WSA 2026 Voters"

### 3. Manual Outbox Processing
- Created `manual-hubspot-sync-fix.js` script
- Processed all 94 pending outbox entries
- Updated outbox status tracking
