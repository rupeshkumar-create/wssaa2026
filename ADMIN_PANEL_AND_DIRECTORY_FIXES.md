# Admin Panel and Directory Issues - RESOLVED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Admin Panel Manual Nominations Failing
**Problem**: Admin panel was unable to submit manual nominations, showing "failed" error.

**Root Cause**: The admin nomination creation API was trying to insert into the `admin_nominations` view instead of creating nominations directly in the proper tables.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `src/app/api/admin/nominations/create/route.ts` to create nominations directly
- Bypassed the `admin_nominations` view which was read-only
- Created the full workflow: nominator â†’ nominee â†’ nomination (auto-approved for admin)

**How it works now**:
1. Creates/reuses admin nominator account
2. Creates nominee record with all provided data
3. Creates approved nomination linking nominator and nominee
4. Nominations appear immediately in the directory

### 2. âœ… Daniel's Profile Visibility Issues
**Problem**: Daniel was updated from admin panel but seemed to have visibility issues.

**Root Cause**: Confusion between two different ID types in the system:
- **Nominee ID**: `8636d3ad-63ba-43e8-95c6-c4bf71e8fe12` (from nominees table)
- **Nomination ID**: `6ccec010-9c34-4de8-9ac2-4ddba8f56ee4` (from nominations table)

**Solution**: Clarified that the system correctly uses **nomination IDs** for individual nominee pages.

**Daniel's Status**:
- âœ… Shows in nominees directory API
- âœ… Shows in search results  
- âœ… Individual page accessible at: `/nominee/6ccec010-9c34-4de8-9ac2-4ddba8f56ee4`
- âœ… Has 258 total votes (251 additional + 7 real votes)
- âœ… Approved nomination in "Rising Star (Under 30)" category

### 3. âœ… Individual Nominee Page API Fixes
**Problem**: Some individual nominee pages were returning 404 errors.

**Root Cause**: The API was using incorrect field references for nominee type detection.

**Solution**: Fixed field references in `src/app/api/nominees/[id]/route.ts`:
- Changed `nominee.type` to `nomineeData?.type`
- Fixed conditional logic for person vs company data

## Files Modified

1. **`src/app/api/admin/nominations/create/route.ts`**
   - Complete rewrite to create nominations directly
   - Bypassed admin_nominations view
   - Added proper nominator/nominee/nomination creation workflow

2. **`src/app/api/admin/nominations/approve/route.ts`**
   - Fixed column name references to match admin_nominations view structure
   - Updated field mappings from draft to final nomination

3. **`src/app/api/nominees/[id]/route.ts`**
   - Fixed nominee type detection logic
   - Corrected field references for person vs company data

## Testing Results

### Admin Nomination Creation
```bash
âœ… Admin nomination created successfully!
âœ… Nominee found in directory!
   Name: Test Admin Nominee
   Type: person
   Votes: 0
```

### Daniel's Visibility
```bash
âœ… Daniel found in nominees API:
   - Daniel Bartakovics (person) - ID: 8636d3ad-63ba-43e8-95c6-c4bf71e8fe12
     Category: rising-star-under-30
     Status: approved
     Votes: 258

âœ… Daniel found in search:
   - Daniel Bartakovics - CEO (name)

âœ… Individual nominee API works with nomination ID!
   Name: Daniel Bartakovics
   Type: person
```

## Key Learnings

1. **ID System**: The system uses nomination IDs (not nominee IDs) for individual pages
2. **Admin Nominations**: Should be created directly in the main tables, not through views
3. **Search Functionality**: Works correctly and finds nominees by name, job title, and company
4. **Directory Display**: Shows all approved nominations with proper vote counts

## URLs for Daniel

- **Directory**: Shows in main nominees list at `/nominees`
- **Individual Page**: `/nominee/6ccec010-9c34-4de8-9ac2-4ddba8f56ee4` (nomination ID)
- **Search**: Appears when searching for "daniel"

All admin panel and directory issues are now resolved! ðŸŽ‰
