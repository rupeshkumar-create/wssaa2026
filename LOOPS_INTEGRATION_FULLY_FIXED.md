# Loops Integration - Fully Fixed âœ…

## Status: COMPLETE âœ…

All Loops integration issues have been successfully resolved. The system is now working correctly for both real-time sync and backup processing.

## Issues Fixed

### âœ… 1. Voters Syncing with Correct User Group
- **Status**: WORKING
- **Verification**: Voters are correctly synced with "Voters" user group
- **Test Result**: âœ… All recent voters have correct user group

### âœ… 2. Nominees Syncing When Approved
- **Status**: WORKING  
- **Verification**: Nominees sync with "Nominess" user group + live URLs when approved
- **Test Result**: âœ… Recent approval test shows nominee correctly synced with live URL

### âœ… 3. Nominators Updating to "Nominator Live"
- **Status**: WORKING
- **Verification**: Nominators update to "Nominator Live" with nominee details when their nominee is approved
- **Test Result**: âœ… Recent approval test shows nominator correctly updated with nominee name and live URL

## Current Working Flow

### Nomination Submission
1. Nominator submits nomination
2. **Real-time sync**: Nominator â†’ Loops with "Nominator" user group
3. **Backup**: If real-time fails, entry created in `loops_outbox`

### Nomination Approval  
1. Admin approves nomination with live URL
2. **Real-time sync**: 
   - Nominee â†’ Loops with "Nominess" user group + live URL
   - Nominator â†’ Updated to "Nominator Live" + nominee details
3. **Backup**: If real-time fails, entry created in `loops_outbox`

### Vote Casting
1. User casts vote
2. **Real-time sync**: Voter â†’ Loops with "Voters" user group
3. **Backup**: If real-time fails, entry created in `loops_outbox`

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
- âœ… `loops_outbox` table created and working
- âœ… Proper event types: `nomination_submitted`, `nomination_approved`, `vote_cast`
- âœ… Status tracking: `pending`, `processing`, `done`, `dead`

### API Integration
- âœ… Loops API client working correctly
- âœ… Custom properties for user groups (`userGroup` field)
- âœ… Contact create/update flow with error handling
- âœ… Proper field mapping between database and Loops

### Real-time Sync
- âœ… `src/server/loops/realtime-sync.ts` - All functions working
- âœ… `src/app/api/nomination/approve/route.ts` - Approval sync working
- âœ… `src/app/api/vote/route.ts` - Vote sync working
- âœ… `src/app/api/nomination/submit/route.ts` - Submission sync working

### Backup Processing
- âœ… `src/app/api/sync/loops/run/route.ts` - Outbox processing working
- âœ… Manual processing scripts available
- âœ… Retry logic with exponential backoff

## Verification Results

### Recent Test Results (100% Success)
```
âœ… Nominee: final-nominee@example.com
   - UserGroup: "Nominess" 
   - Live URL: https://worldstaffingawards.com/nominee/...

âœ… Nominator: final-nominator@example.com  
   - UserGroup: "Nominator Live"
   - Nominee Name: "Final Nominee"
   - Nominee Live URL: https://worldstaffingawards.com/nominee/...

âœ… Voter: rafyuyospe@necub.com
   - UserGroup: "Voters"

âœ… Nominator: rfr07@powerscrews.com
   - UserGroup: "Nominator"
```

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:
```env
LOOPS_SYNC_ENABLED=true
LOOPS_API_KEY=your_loops_api_key_here
```

## Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
- Real-time sync logs show in API responses
- Success/failure logged to console
- Non-blocking: failures don't break the main workflow

### Backup Processing
- Check `loops_outbox` table for pending items
- Process manually: `node scripts/process-current-pending-loops.js`
- Or via API: `POST /api/sync/loops/run` (requires CRON_SECRET)

### Health Check
- Run verification: `node scripts/verify-loops-working-correctly.js`
- Check API status: `GET /api/sync/loops/run`

## Summary

ðŸŽ‰ **The Loops integration is now fully operational!**

- âœ… **Real-time sync**: All user types sync correctly with proper user groups
- âœ… **Backup sync**: Failed syncs are queued and can be processed later  
- âœ… **User groups**: Correct assignment and updates for all user types
- âœ… **Live URLs**: Nominees get live URLs, nominators get nominee details
- âœ… **Error handling**: Robust retry logic and fallback mechanisms

The system will now correctly sync all future nominations, approvals, and votes to Loops with the appropriate user groups and data.
