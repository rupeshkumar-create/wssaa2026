# HubSpot Sync - Issues Fixed âœ…

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. âœ… Missing Custom Properties
**Problem**: Required WSA custom properties didn't exist in HubSpot
**Solution**: Created all required properties using the setup script

**Properties Created**:
- **Contact Properties**: `wsa_role`, `wsa_nominated_display_name`, `wsa_nominator_status`, `wsa_voted_for_display_name`, `wsa_voted_subcategory_id`, `wsa_vote_timestamp`, `wsa_live_url`
- **Company Properties**: `wsa_role`, `wsa_live_url`

### 2. âœ… Incorrect Source Property
**Problem**: Code was using `hs_lead_source` which doesn't exist
**Solution**: Updated to use `source` property and added "WSA26" as a valid option

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `src/server/hubspot/map.ts` to use `source: 'WSA26'`
- Added "WSA26" as an enumeration option to the HubSpot `source` property

### 3. âœ… LinkedIn URL Mapping
**Problem**: LinkedIn URLs were not syncing properly
**Solution**: Verified LinkedIn property mapping is working correctly

## Test Results

### âœ… Direct HubSpot Contact Creation Test
```bash
node scripts/test-direct-hubspot-contact.js
```

**Result**: Contact created successfully with all properties:
- **ID**: 150219987579

- **LinkedIn**: https://linkedin.com/in/testvoter âœ…
- **Source**: WSA26 âœ…
- **WSA Role**: Voter âœ…
- **All WSA Properties**: Working âœ…

### âœ… Contact Search Verification
```bash
node scripts/search-contact-simple.js
```

**Result**: Contact found with all properties correctly populated.

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix API Routes (404 Issue)
The API endpoints are returning 404 errors. This needs to be resolved for the application sync to work.

**Possible causes**:
- Next.js build issue
- Route configuration problem
- Development server not recognizing API routes

### 2. Add Missing Ticket Scopes
For nomination sync to work, add these scopes to your HubSpot Private App:
- `crm.objects.tickets.read`
- `crm.objects.tickets.write`
- `tickets` (or `tickets.highly_sensitive.v2`)

### 3. Create Ticket Pipeline
Create a pipeline called "WSA 2026 Nominations" with stages:
- Submitted
- Under Review  
- Approved
- Rejected

## Environment Configuration

Your `.env.local` is correctly configured:
```bash
HUBSPOT_TOKEN=your_hubspot_api_token_here
HUBSPOT_CONTACT_LINKEDIN_KEY=linkedin
HUBSPOT_COMPANY_LINKEDIN_KEY=linkedin_company_page
HUBSPOT_SYNC_ENABLED=true
```

## Summary

ðŸŽ‰ **HubSpot sync is now working for contacts!**

The core sync functionality is operational:
- âœ… Contact creation with all WSA properties
- âœ… LinkedIn URL syncing
- âœ… Source tracking (WSA26)
- âœ… All custom WSA properties

The remaining issue is the API route 404 errors, which prevents the application from triggering the sync. Once that's resolved, the full integration will be functional.
