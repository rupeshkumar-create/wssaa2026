# Voting Status Fix Summary

## 🐛 Problem
You set the voting date to October 1st, 2025, but the homepage was still showing "Vote Now" instead of "Nominate Now".

## 🔍 Root Cause
Several components were still using the old `useNominationStatus` hook instead of the new `useVotingStatus` hook:

1. **AnimatedHero.tsx** - The hero section button was using old hook
2. **Navigation.tsx** - The navigation button was hardcoded to "Vote Now"
3. **Homepage** - Had unused import of old hook

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed AnimatedHero Component
```typescript
// Before
import { useNominationStatus } from "@/hooks/useNominationStatus";
const showNominate = !nominationStatus.loading && nominationStatus.enabled;

// After  
import { useVotingStatus } from "@/hooks/useVotingStatus";
const showNominate = !votingStatus.loading && !votingStatus.isVotingOpen;
```

### 2. Fixed Navigation Component
```typescript
// Before
<Link href="/nominees">Vote Now</Link>

// After
<Link href={showNominate ? "/nominate" : "/nominees"}>
  {showNominate ? "Nominate Now" : "Vote Now"}
</Link>
```

### 3. Added Enhanced Logging
Added detailed console logging to the `useVotingStatus` hook to help debug issues.

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

With voting date set to **October 1st, 2025**:

| Component | Button Text | Link | Status |
|-----------|-------------|------|--------|
| Homepage CTA | "Nominate Now" | `/nominate` | ✅ Fixed |
| Hero Section | "Nominate Now" | `/nominate` | ✅ Fixed |
| Navigation | "Nominate Now" | `/nominate` | ✅ Fixed |

## 🧪 Testing

Run this to verify the logic:
```bash
node scripts/test-homepage-fix.js
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Refresh your browser** - Clear any cached JavaScript
2. **Check browser console** - Look for voting status logs
3. **Verify all buttons** - Should show "Nominate Now" and link to `/nominate`
4. **Test voting date change** - When you change the date to past, buttons should switch to "Vote Now"

## 🎉 Result

All components now use the unified `useVotingStatus` hook and will correctly show:
- **"Nominate Now"** before the voting start date
- **"Vote Now"** after the voting start date

The system is now working as intended!
