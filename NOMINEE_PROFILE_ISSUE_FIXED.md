# Nominee Profile Issue Fixed âœ…

## Problem
After approving nominations, users were getting "Failed to fetch nominee" error when trying to view nominee profiles.

## Root Cause
Multiple API endpoints were calling `createClient()` without `await` after we made the Supabase client async to fix Next.js 15 compatibility issues.

## Files Fixed

### 1. Primary Issue - Nominee API âœ…
**File**: `src/app/api/nominee/[slug]/route.ts`
**Issues Fixed**:
- Added `await` before `createClient()`
- Fixed Next.js 15 params issue: `{ params }: { params: Promise<{ slug: string }> }`
- Added `await params` when destructuring
- Changed from `public_nominees` table to `nominations` table with `status = 'approved'` filter

### 2. Additional API Endpoints Fixed âœ…
**Files Fixed**:
- `src/app/api/debug/nominee/route.ts` - Added `await createClient()`
- `src/app/api/stats/route.ts` - Added `await createClient()`
- `src/app/api/uploads/debug/route.ts` - Added `await createClient()`
- `src/app/api/podium/route.ts` - Added `await createClient()`
- `src/app/api/nominees/route.ts` - Added `await createClient()`
- `src/app/api/test/storage/route.ts` - Added `await createClient()`

### 3. Previously Fixed (Image Upload Issue) âœ…
**Files Already Fixed**:
- `src/app/api/uploads/image/route.ts` - Added `await createClient()`
- `src/app/api/nominations/route.ts` - Added `imageUrl` field to nomination object

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
- **Table**: `nominations` (not `public_nominees`)
- **Status Filter**: Only `status = 'approved'` nominations are publicly accessible
- **Image Storage**: Supabase Storage with public URLs
- **Slug Mapping**: `live_slug` field maps to URL paths

### API Structure
```javascript
// Nominee API Response
{
  id: "uuid",
  category: "Top Recruiter",
  type: "person",
  nominee: {
    name: "Nominee Name",
    title: "Job Title",
    country: "Country",
    linkedin: "LinkedIn URL",
    imageUrl: "Image URL or null"
  },
  liveUrl: "/nominee/slug",
  status: "approved",
  votes: 0,
  whyVoteForMe: "Description"
}
```

### Error Handling
- **404**: Nominee not found or not approved
- **500**: Server/database errors
- **400**: Invalid parameters
- **Proper logging**: All errors logged to console

## Next Steps

### âœ… **System is Production Ready**
