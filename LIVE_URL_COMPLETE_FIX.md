# Live URL Complete Fix

## Issue Fixed

The "Live URL (Optional)" field in the admin panel was showing placeholder text `https://example.com` instead of actual live URLs assigned to approved nominees.

## Root Cause

1. **Database Storage**: Live URLs were not being properly stored in the `nominations.live_url` field during approval
2. **API Mapping**: The approval API was not updating the `live_url` field in the database
3. **Admin Panel**: The admin edit API was trying to store live URLs in the wrong table

## Complete Solution

### 1. Database Schema Fix
- **File**: `LIVE_URL_DATABASE_FIX.sql`
- Ensures `live_url` column exists in `nominations` table
- Creates/updates `admin_nominations` view to include live URLs
- Updates existing approved nominations with generated URLs
- Adds performance indexes

### 2. Approval API Fix
- **File**: `src/app/api/nomination/approve/route.ts`
- Added live URL storage: `updateData.live_url = validatedData.liveUrl`
- Ensures approved nominees get their live URLs stored in database

### 3. Admin Panel API Fix
- **File**: `src/app/api/admin/nominations/route.ts`
- Fixed PATCH endpoint to store `live_url` in `nominations` table (not `nominees`)
- Proper data mapping from `nominee_live_url` to `liveUrl`

### 4. Frontend Integration
- **File**: `src/components/admin/EnhancedEditDialog.tsx`
- Already correctly initializes `liveUrl` from nomination data
- Displays and allows editing of live URLs

## How It Works Now

### Approval Workflow
1. Admin clicks "Approve" on a nomination
2. `ApprovalDialog` opens with URL assignment
3. Admin can auto-generate or manually enter live URL
4. On approval, live URL is stored in `nominations.live_url`
5. Success message shows the assigned URL

### Admin Panel Display
1. Admin panel fetches nominations via `/api/admin/nominations`
2. API queries `admin_nominations` view including `nominee_live_url`
3. Data is mapped to `liveUrl` field for frontend
4. Live URLs display in nomination cards and edit dialogs

### URL Generation
- **Format**: `https://worldstaffingawards.com/nominee/{slug}`
- **Slug Creation**: Name → lowercase → remove special chars → replace spaces with hyphens
- **Examples**:
  - "John Smith" → `john-smith`
  - "ABC Company Ltd." → `abc-company-ltd`

## Testing

### Run Database Fix
```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
\i LIVE_URL_DATABASE_FIX.sql
```

### Run Verification Scripts
```bash
# Fix existing data and verify structure
node scripts/fix-live-url-storage.js

# Test complete functionality
node scripts/test-live-url-complete.js
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, state, live_url, firstname, lastname, company_name 
   FROM nominations 
   WHERE state = 'approved';
   ```

2. **Test Admin Panel**:
   - Open admin panel
   - Check approved nominations show live URLs (not placeholder)
   - Edit a nomination and verify live URL field is populated

3. **Test Approval Process**:
   - Approve a new nomination
   - Verify live URL is assigned and displayed
   - Check database has the URL stored

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
- Live URL field shows `https://example.com` placeholder
- Approved nominees have no live URLs
- Admin panel shows empty URL fields

### After Fix
- Live URL field shows actual assigned URLs
- Approved nominees have proper live URLs like `https://worldstaffingawards.com/nominee/john-smith`
- Admin panel displays and allows editing of live URLs
- New approvals automatically get live URLs assigned

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/nomination/approve/route.ts` - Store live URL during approval
2. `src/app/api/admin/nominations/route.ts` - Fix live URL updates
3. `LIVE_URL_DATABASE_FIX.sql` - Database schema and data fixes
4. `scripts/fix-live-url-storage.js` - Data migration script
5. `scripts/test-live-url-complete.js` - Comprehensive testing
