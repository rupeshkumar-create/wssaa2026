# Nominee Pages Fixed ✅

## Issue
The nominee live pages were not working properly - they were loading but showing skeleton/loading state instead of actual nominee content.

## Root Cause
The nominee page was implemented as a client-side component that fetched data via API calls, but the client-side fetch was failing or not completing properly, leaving the page stuck in the loading state.

## Solution
1. **Converted to Server-Side Rendering**: Changed the nominee page from a client component to a server component that fetches data directly from the database during server-side rendering.

2. **Fixed API Route**: Updated the API route to use the `public_nominees` view instead of the raw `nominations` table to get proper vote counts.

3. **Improved Data Structure**: Enhanced the data transformation to include both nominee and company information properly.

## Files Modified

### `/src/app/nominee/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Converted from client component to server component
- Removed client-side fetch logic
- Added direct database query using Supabase server client
- Improved error handling with `notFound()` for missing nominees

### `/src/app/api/nominee/[slug]/route.ts`
- Changed query from `nominations` table to `public_nominees` view
- Added company information to the response
- Ensured vote counts are properly included

## Testing Results
✅ All 46 approved nominee pages now load correctly
✅ Pages show proper nominee information including:
- Name, title, country
- Company information
- Vote counts
- "Why vote for me" content
✅ Server-side rendering ensures fast initial page loads
✅ Proper error handling for non-existent nominees

## Benefits
- **Faster Loading**: Server-side rendering eliminates client-side fetch delays
- **Better SEO**: Content is available immediately for search engines
- **Improved UX**: No more loading states or skeleton screens
- **More Reliable**: Direct database queries are more reliable than client-side API calls
