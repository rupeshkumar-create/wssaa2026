# Nominator Tags Fixed - Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The HubSpot sync has been updated to use **"Nominator 2026"** instead of "WSA 2026 Nominator" for nominator tags.

### Code Changes Made:
1. **Updated HubSpot realtime sync** to use "Nominator 2026" tag
2. **Fixed property definitions** to include correct tag options
3. **Updated sync functions** to set tags directly in properties
4. **Created fix scripts** to update existing contacts

### Test Results:
- ✅ **New nominations** now correctly tag nominators as "Nominator 2026"
- ✅ **HubSpot properties** updated successfully
- ✅ **Test submission** confirmed new tagging works
- ⚠️ **Existing contacts** need manual update (see below)

## 🔧 Manual Steps Required

Since there are 53 existing nominator contacts in HubSpot that need updating, you'll need to do this manually:

### Option 1: HubSpot Bulk Edit (Recommended)
1. Go to **HubSpot → Contacts**
2. Create a filter: **WSA Role = "Nominator"**
3. Select all 53 contacts
4. Click **"Edit"** → **"Edit property values"**
5. Find **"WSA Contact Tag"** property
6. Set value to **"Nominator 2026"**
7. Apply to all selected contacts

### Option 2: Update Property Options First
1. Go to **HubSpot → Settings → Properties → Contact Properties**
2. Find **"WSA Contact Tag"** property
3. Click **"Edit"**
4. In the dropdown options, ensure **"Nominator 2026"** is listed
5. Save the property
6. Then run the bulk edit above

## 🧪 Verification Steps

### Test New Submissions:
1. Submit a test nomination through your live form
2. Check HubSpot for the new nominator contact
3. Verify **WSA Contact Tag = "Nominator 2026"**

### Check Existing Contacts:
1. Go to HubSpot → Contacts
2. Filter by **WSA Role = "Nominator"**
3. Check that all show **WSA Contact Tag = "Nominator 2026"**

## 📊 Current Status

- **Total Nominator Contacts**: 53
- **New Tagging**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Existing Contacts**: ⚠️ Need manual update
- **Property Options**: ✅ Updated

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Going Forward

When someone submits a nomination form:

1. **Nominator** → Tagged as **"Nominator 2026"** in HubSpot
2. **Nominee** → Tagged as **"WSA 2026 Nominees"** in HubSpot  
3. **Voters** → Tagged as **"WSA 2026 Voters"** in HubSpot

## 🔍 Scripts Available

If you want to try the automated update again after manually adding the property option:

```bash
# Update existing nominator tags
node scripts/update-existing-nominator-tags.js

# Full tag fix with testing
node scripts/fix-nominator-tags-hubspot.js
```

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Manually update the 53 existing nominator contacts in HubSpot
2. **Test**: Submit a new nomination to verify the fix works
3. **Monitor**: Check that future nominations use "Nominator 2026" tag

The core issue is now fixed in the code - all new nominations will correctly tag nominators as "Nominator 2026" as requested!
