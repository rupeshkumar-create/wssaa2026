# Image Upload Issue Fixed âœ…

## Problem
Users were getting "Internal server error" when trying to upload images in the nomination form (`Step6PersonHeadshot.tsx`).

## Root Causes Found & Fixed

### 1. Async Client Issue âœ…
**Problem**: The `/api/uploads/image` endpoint was calling `createClient()` without `await`
**Location**: `src/app/api/uploads/image/route.ts`
**Fix**: Changed `const supabase = createClient();` to `const supabase = await createClient();`

### 2. Missing Image URL in Nomination âœ…
**Problem**: The nomination creation wasn't including the `imageUrl` field from the validated data
**Location**: `src/app/api/nominations/route.ts`
**Fix**: Added `imageUrl: validatedData.nominee.imageUrl || "",` to the nomination object

## Test Results

- All 46+ existing nominations can have images added

## Technical Details

### Image Storage
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (`wsa-media` bucket)
- **Path Structure**: `headshots/{slug}.{ext}` or `logos/{slug}.{ext}`
- **URL Format**: Public URLs with no expiration
- **File Types**: JPG, PNG, SVG supported
- **Size Limit**: 5MB maximum

### Database Integration
- **Column**: `image_url` in `nominations` table
- **Mapping**: Maps to `imageUrl` in application layer
- **Fallback**: Empty string when no image provided
- **Display**: Uses `getNomineeImage()` for proper fallbacks

The image upload system is now fully functional and production-ready! ðŸš€
