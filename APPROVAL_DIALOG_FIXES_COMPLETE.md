## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `src/components/admin/EnhancedEditDialog.tsx` - Fixed button visibility
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Integrated ApprovalDialog
- `src/app/api/nomination/approve/route.ts` - Enhanced response with URL info

### Files Created
- `src/components/admin/ApprovalDialog.tsx` - New approval workflow component
- `scripts/test-approval-dialog.js` - Test script for approval functionality

### Key Features
- **URL Generation**: `https://worldstaffingawards.com/nominee/{slug}`
- **Slug Creation**: Converts names to URL-safe slugs
- **Real-time Sync**: Continues to sync to HubSpot and Loops with live URL
- **Outbox Backup**: Maintains backup sync queues
- **Success Messages**: Shows assigned URL in confirmation

## URL Assignment Process

When a nomination is approved:
1. Admin enters or auto-generates live URL
2. URL is validated and previewed
3. Approval creates/updates nominee record with URL
4. URL is included in all sync operations (HubSpot, Loops)
5. URL is shown in success message
6. Nominator receives notification with live URL
7. Nominee appears in public directory with URL

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
cd world-staffing-awards
node scripts/test-approval-dialog.js
```

The test verifies:
- URL generation algorithm
- Approval API functionality
- Database updates
- Outbox entry creation
- Success response format
