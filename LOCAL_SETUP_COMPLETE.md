# ✅ Local Setup Complete!

Your World Staffing Awards application is now running successfully in local development mode.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Settings API Error (HTTP 500)
**Problem**: The settings API was failing because it was trying to connect to Supabase with placeholder credentials.

**Solution**: Updated the settings API (`/api/settings`) to detect placeholder Supabase credentials and return default settings for local development.

### 2. Nominees API Fallback
**Problem**: Similar Supabase connection issues in the nominees API.

**Solution**: Enhanced the fallback mechanism to detect placeholder credentials and return demo data.

### 3. Podium API Fallback
**Problem**: Podium API also had Supabase dependency issues.

**Solution**: Updated the credential detection logic to work with placeholder values.

### 4. Missing Directory Page
**Problem**: The directory page file was not in the correct location.

**Solution**: Created the missing `/src/app/directory/page.tsx` file.
